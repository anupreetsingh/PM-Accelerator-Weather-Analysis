## 2) PM Accelerator Mission (from the program’s site)

By making industry-leading tools and education available to individuals from all backgrounds, we level the playing field for future PM leaders. This is the PM Accelerator motto, as we grant aspiring and experienced PMs what they need most – Access. We introduce you to industry leaders, surround you with the right PM ecosystem, and discover the new world of AI product management skills.

## 3) How the Script Fulfills Each Requirement

### A. **Data Loading & Setup**
- Reads `GlobalWeatherRepository.csv` and parses **`last_updated`** as a timestamp.
- Creates project folders: `visualizations/`, `models/`, and `reports/` for organized outputs.
- Prints dataset shape, date range, schema, and missing‑value summary for quick sanity checks.

### B. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Basic)
- **Missing values:** Imputes numeric columns with **median** and categorical with **mode**.
- **Outliers:** Applies **IQR rule per numerical column** to filter extreme values.
- **Normalization:** Standardizes all numeric features via **`StandardScaler`** (a copy `df_normalized` is kept).

### C. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Basic)
- **Distributions**: Made Histograms for showing frequency distribution of values of temperature (°C/°F), precipitation, humidity, wind, pressure → saved to `visualizations/basic_distributions.png`.
- **Correlations**: Made Heatmap across key weather variables to find correlation between them→ saved to `visualizations/correlation_matrix.png`.
- **Bivariate**: Made scatter plot to show bivariate relationship between discrete values of Temperature vs. Precipitation → saved to `visualizations/temp_vs_precip.png`.
- **Time Series Trends**: Aggregates records of all places by **date** and plots **daily averages** for temperature, precipitation, humidity, and pressure to see trends change with time  → saved to `visualizations/time_series_analysis.png`.

### D. **Model Building & Forecasting** (Basic → Advanced)
- **Time‑aware split**: Sorts by `last_updated` and performs an **80/20 chronological split** -80%for training and 20% for testing. This prevents leakage by ensuring that future data is not used to predict the past.
- **Feature Engineering**: From time stamp and weather records new features are extracted.
  - **Time based:** hour, day, month, day_of_week, day_of_year, is_weekend
  - **Location/Weather based:** latitude/longitude, humidity, pressure, wind, precip, visibility, cloud, uv_index.
- **Scaling**: "StandardScaler" is fit on the training set only (to avoid future info leakage) and then applied to both training and test sets.
- **Models trained**: 
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest** 
  - **Support Vector Regression(RBF Kernel)**.
- **Ensembles**: 
  - **Voting Regressor**: Combines predictions from multiple models by averaging them.
  - **Stacking Regressor** Uses predictions of base models (e.g., RF, SVR) as inputs to a meta-model (here, Linear Regression) that learns how to best combine them.
- **Evaluation**: Computes **R², RMSE, MAE** for each model and logs to console.
- **Forecast Plot**: Compares **Actual vs. Predicted** on the held‑out **future horizon** using the **best model** → saved to `visualizations/forecast_time_plot.png`.
- **Model Comparison Plot**: Bar charts for **R²** and **RMSE** across all models → saved to `visualizations/model_comparison.png`.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves **best model** to `models/best_weather_model.pkl` and the **scaler** to `models/weather_scaler.pkl` for reuse/deployment.

### E. **Advanced EDA — Anomaly Detection** (Advanced)
Advanced EDA is about digging deeper into data quality: are there bad readings, faulty sensors, or extreme rare weather events? We use two techniques here:
- Uses Machine Learning Algorithm **Isolation Forest** on selected numeric features to detect anomalies (contamination=0.10) → For overview view chart saved in **`visualizations/anomaly_detection.png`**.
- **Statistical outliers** via **z‑scores** and annotated histograms → **`visualizations/statistical_outliers.png`**.

### F. **Unique Analyses** (Advanced)
- **Climate Analysis**: If you Divide the continuous value of latitude across globe into broad latitude bands(bins), then you'd get:
  - Northern Polar (66°–90° N)
  - Southern Polar (66°–90° S)
  - Northern Temperate (23°–66° N)
  - Southern Temperate (23°–66° S)
  - Northern Tropical/Equatorial (0°–23° N)
  - Southern Tropical/Equatorial (0°–23° S)

  We plot temperature trends for 4 of these bins → saved in `visualizations/climate_analysis.png`.

- **Environmental Impact**: Computes **correlation matrix** between **air‑quality** metrics (e.g., CO, O3, NO₂, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10) and weather features to see how weather is linked to pollution→ saved in `visualizations/air_quality_correlation.png`.

- **Feature Importance**: 
Two complementary methods for ranking which features matter most:
  - **Random Forest** feature importances. RF naturally computes feature importance (based on how much each split reduces error across trees). Good for nonlinear and interaction-heavy datasets.
  - **Correlation‑based** Compute absolute Pearson r between each feature and the target (temperature, say). High |r| = stronger linear relationship.

  Side‑by‑side comparison helps check if machine learning feature rankings agree with simple correlations?→ saved in `visualizations/feature_importance_comparison.png`.

- **Spatial Analysis**: **K‑Means** clustering (k=5), maps clusters and global distributions(by latitude/longitude) for features such as temperature, humidity, and pressure → saved in `visualizations/spatial_analysis.png`.
- **Geographical Patterns**: Top‑10 **countries** by observation count; bar charts drawn for **average temperature, precipitation, humidity** and **temperature variability** → saveed in `visualizations/geographical_patterns.png`.

### G. **Auto‑Generated Report**
- Creates a human‑readable Markdown summary at **`reports/comprehensive_analysis_report.md`** that:
  - Recaps dataset scope and date range.
  - Summarizes **anomaly counts** and **model metrics** (R²/RMSE/MAE).
  - Highlights **climate**, **environmental**, **feature importance**, **spatial**, and **geographical** findings.
  - Notes the **best model** chosen and files saved.

> ✅ Together, these steps fully satisfy both **Basic** and **Advanced** assessment requirements.

## 4) Artifacts Produced by the Script

**Directories created:**
- `visualizations/` — all figures referenced above.
- `models/` — `best_weather_model.pkl`, `weather_scaler.pkl`.
- `reports/` — `comprehensive_analysis_report.md` (auto‑generated).

> **Tip:** You can embed any of the `.png` plots in your GitHub README or slide deck. The PM Accelerator mission (below) can also be added verbatim to your slide’s title or overview page.

## 6) Methodology Notes & Good Practices

- **Time‑Aware Evaluation**: Using a chronological split reflects real‑world forecasting and avoids leakage from future into past.
- **Multiple Metrics**: Reporting **R², RMSE, MAE** provides a rounded view of error magnitude and explained variance.
- **Ensembles**: Voting/Stacking often improve generalization by combining diverse model biases/variances.
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed `random_state` where applicable; models and scaler are saved for consistent reuse.
- **Potential Enhancements**:
  - Use **`TimeSeriesSplit`** or **rolling‑window backtests** for even more robust temporal validation.
  - Add **hyperparameter tuning** (e.g., `RandomizedSearchCV`) for RF/SVR.
  - Explore **per‑region** or **per‑country** specialized models.
  - Consider **lag features** and **holiday/seasonality** indicators for richer temporal signals.
